# To-do

1. Make the animations work for plotting.py. The static plot seems to work but the animate function doesn't behave as expected when used in the animation function of matplotlib. Maybe use plotly? Maybe make matplotlib work?
2. For some reason the communication.py module doesn't work anymore????? investigate....
3. clean up and document the cmd class found in the old main.py and transfer it to new main.py.
